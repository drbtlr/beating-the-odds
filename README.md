# Beating the Odds

This repository contains web guides, R code, and sample data to help education data analysts identify schools that perform better than expected, given the unique student populations they serve. This guide presents the procedures used to identify beating-the-odds schools using a synthetic dataset based on real student data. The analysis is based on study by the [Kentucky Department of Education](https://education.ky.gov/) and [REL Appalachia](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/regions/appalachia/). This material can also be accessed on the OpenSDP website at [opensdp.github.io/analysis](https://opensdp.github.io/analysis).

The code in this repository is based on code from the "Analyze" section of the [Strategic Data Project Toolkit for Effective Data Use](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/toolkit-effective-data-use).

This repository is organized in the following folder structure:

- `code` contains the R code of the analysis (and renders the guide)
- `R` contains R functions necessary to complete the analysis
- `data` contains data necessary to complete the analysis
- `img` contains images to format the guides
- `includes` contains style assets to format the guides
- `man` contains the manuals and descriptive files of the data

These materials were originally authored by Aaron Butler and Hannah Poquette.

[OpenSDP](https://opensdp.github.io) is an online, public repository of analytic code, tools, and training intended to foster collaboration among education analysts and researchers in order to accelerate the improvement of our school systems. The community is hosted by the [Strategic Data Project](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu), an initiative of the [Center for Education Policy Research at Harvard University](https://cepr.harvard.edu).

We welcome contributions and feedback.
